Outline
---------
This is an interactive map designed with the help of Unfolding maps library, Processing library and Google maps API.
Two different types of data has been included in this, earthquake dataset and airport dataset. Earthquakes have been drawn in the shape of markers, color coded with extra keys for recent, high magnitude, low magnitude, in the sea and on the land. Map key has been added on the left of the map.
Second data is the Airport dataset, all the airports are shown in the map. if one airport is clicked, other airports dissappear until another click. All the routes out of an airports are shown when an aiport is clicked. A particular airport can be searched based on the input to the program
Labels have been added to the markers on the map, which are shown on hoover








This project uses unfolding maps, Processing libraries and Google API to show and process the map information correctly.  
An interactive map has been designed to show and process different information in the form of markers.  
In the first part, earthquake data has been plotted on the map. The greater the magnitude of earthquake has been color coded in three colors i-e red, yellow and blue.   
In the second part, all the cities have been drawn in triangular shape on the map.  
The location of the earthquakes has been determined if they are in the city, land or in water.  
Earthquake key has been added on the top left side of the map.  
Earthquakes which have recently occured have been distinguished with an 'X' mark drawn on top of them.  
Hoover effect has been added to the appplication and a label is shown every time mouse hoovers over a marker    


In the extension, the users enters the name of the country to view the airports only of that country or just press enter to view the airports of the world

if the user clicks on any airport, the program shows all the routes out of that airport and the destination airports

on second click all the routes disappear

if the user clicks on any other airport, all the routes out of that airport are shown.

NOTE: in some airports, there are no routes!
