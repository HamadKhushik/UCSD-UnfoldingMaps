Outline
---------
1. This is an interactive map designed with the help of the Unfolding maps library and Processing library.
2. Two datasets have been included in this program i-e the earthquake dataset and the airport dataset. Earthquakes have been drawn in the shape of markers, colour-coded with different colours and shapes for recent, high magnitude, and low magnitude, sea and on-land earthquakes. 
3. Map key has been added on the left of the map.
4. Second data is the Airport dataset; all the airports are shown on the map. 
5. This has been made interactive with mouse clicks. All the routes out of an airport are shown when an airport is clicked. All airports in a country can be searched based on the input to the program. 
6. Labels have been added to the markers(Airports, Earthquakes, cities) on the map, which are shown on hoover

Description
-----------------


- The airport dataset has been implemented in the extension(Described below)

- Earthquake data has been plotted on the map. The earthquakeâ€™s magnitude has been colour-coded in red, yellow and blue.   
- All the cities have been plotted in a triangular shape on the map.  
- Methods have been implemented to determine whether the earthquake is on land or sea.
- The earthquake key has been added on the top left side of the map.  
- Earthquakes that have recently occurred have been distinguished with an 'X' mark drawn.  
- The Hoover effect has been added to the application, and a label is shown every time the mouse hovers over any marker.   
- Some output from the program is attached below.

Extension
----------------
The program has been extended to include the following features.

1. If the users enter the name of the country at the input prompt, only airports of that country will be shown, or just press enter to view the airports of the world   
2. if the user clicks on any airport, the program will show all the routes out of that airport and the destination airports. The remaining airports will disappear from the map.
3. on the second click, all the routes will disappear, and the remaining airports will re-appear.  
If the user clicks on any other airport, all the routes out of that airport are shown.
4. Some output from the program is shown below

NOTE: in some airports, there are no routes(in the dataset used)!

This is a UCSD course project for Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.
The files provided were skeleton code, grading previews and testing files to complete the course programming assignments.
